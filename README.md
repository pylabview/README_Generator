# Fancy README Generator

## Description
_______________________________________
The README file is a special touch for any application. However, sometimes we are too busy to pay attention to this requirement, and this application was created to facilitate that task. 

This application uses node.js and the inquirer package (CLI tool); I have a lot of fun coding this app!

Cheers!

## Installation
_______________________________________

- Clone application repo from github:
```git clone git@github.com:pylabview/README_Generator.git```
- Go inside the repo folders:
```cd <REPO_PATH>```
- Install dependencies:
```npm i```
- Run index.js:
```node index```


## Usage
_______________________________________

The application has simple entries for the README title,  and contact info (email, Github user). 

For the other fields (description, installation and usage), it will open your default text editor for
usage and instructions. For Windows, this is set during git bash installation and can be modified on the config globals:

	$ ```git config --global core.editor "code --wait" for vs code```

- Note: ```you should be available open vs code from the terminal. This can be achieved by adding it to the PATH```
- Note: ```If there is no text editor set, the default is Vim.```
